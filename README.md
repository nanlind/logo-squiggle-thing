### Up next

- Improve bicycle chain movement
- Order micro controller and breakout board
- Make textile prototype / experiments
- Clean up code
- add pointer coord on 'd'

### In progress

- Properly close port after drawing

### Bugs

- When trying to reflect node segment a second time, nodes disappear from screen and do not get new coords (unless paused first and then played).

### Done

- Get directions from Serial/Arduino
- Draw squiggle with sensors

### Temporary idea for the sensor-thingy

- Two modules
  - A board with sensors that hold their values
  - Body sensors that has a baseline of 0(-ish).
